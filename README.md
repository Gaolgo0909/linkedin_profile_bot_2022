# linkedin_profile_bot_2022
In this repository  I developed a BOT to extract data from profiles of employees of a give list of companies. 
Four limitations of this project are worth of mention: (i) since Linkedin doens't want you to do web scraping, even though it's 100% percent legal, they develop a lot of ways to limitate ones gathering of data. And if you use this BOT with no discretion **Linkedin may ban your account**; (ii) Because of this, the BOT couldn't extract 100% of the profiles that was providade. When I was using for tests, usually I could get information for something like 91% of all profiles; (iii) Linkedin shows the profile of only the first thousand of employees of each company, and because of that, it is only possible to gather information of this first thousand and finally, (iv) you need to make sure that the name of the company that you are searching for is writen in your list the same way that is writen in their linkedin profile.
